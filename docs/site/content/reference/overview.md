# About the API Reference

This section provides access to the low-level API documentation for the various projects within the Firestone ecosystem. Unlike the narrative guides, which explain how to use the tools, the API reference is a detailed, automatically generated documentation of the source code itself—including modules, classes, functions, and their signatures.

## Docs-from-Code Philosophy

A core principle of the Firestone project is that API documentation should be generated directly from the source code. This ensures that the reference is always up-to-date and accurately reflects the implementation.

-   For **Python projects** (`firestone`, `firestone-lib`), the reference is generated from Python docstrings using `pdoc`.
-   For the **`bindy` Rust project**, the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) reference is generated from Rust doc comments using a custom `crddoc` tool.
-   For the **`bindcar` Rust project**, the reference is the standard HTML documentation generated by `rustdoc`.

## What You Will Find Here

This section is divided into guides for the different types of API references available. You will learn:

-   How to generate each type of API reference.
-   How to interpret the generated documentation.
-   How to contribute to the documentation by improving the source code comments and docstrings.

## Who Should Use the API Reference?

The API reference is intended for developers who are:

-   **Extending Firestone**: If you are building a new feature or fixing a bug, the API reference is an essential tool for understanding the internal workings of the codebase.
-   **Deeply Integrating with Firestone**: If you are building complex integrations that go beyond the standard CLI or REST API usage, you may need to interact with the Python or Rust APIs directly.
-   **Troubleshooting**: When a high-level guide is not enough, the API reference provides the ground truth of the code's behavior.

For most users, the [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started/) and [Best Practices](common-patterns-cheat-sheet.md) will be more than sufficient. This section is for those who need to dive deeper into the code itself.
