## Resource-First Design

Firestone is built on a simple premise: **Your Resource Schema is the Single Source of Truth.**

Instead of writing code, implementation details, or separate documentation, you define your resources (data models, relationships, operations) in a technology-agnostic schema. Firestone then automates the rest.

**Key Benefits:**
*   **Consistency:** The API spec, CLI, and UI are always in sync because they are generated from the same definition.
*   **Speed:** Prototyping involves writing YAML, not boilerplate code.
*   **Clarity:** The schema acts as a clear contract for both humans and machines.
