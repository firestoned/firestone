## Hosting Your Spec

The `openapi.yaml` file generated by Firestone is a static artifact. You can host it anywhere:

1.  **Static Site:** GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel.
2.  **API Endpoint:** Serve it from your backend at `GET /openapi.yaml`.
3.  **Developer Portal:** Upload it to SwaggerHub, Redocly, or ReadMe.

## Best Practice: Versioned URLs

Serve specs at versioned URLs to prevent breaking changes for consumers:

*   `https://api.example.com/v1/openapi.yaml`
*   `https://api.example.com/v2/openapi.yaml`

This allows you to maintain multiple API versions in parallel, supported by Firestone's `apiVersion` configuration.
