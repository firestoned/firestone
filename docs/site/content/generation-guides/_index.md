# Generation Guides

Once you've defined your resources, Firestone can generate multiple outputs from that single source of truth.

## What Can Firestone Generate?

From one resource schema, you can create:

- **OpenAPI Specifications** - REST API documentation and contracts
- **AsyncAPI Specifications** - WebSocket and event-driven API docs
- **CLI Tools** - Command-line interfaces with full CRUD operations
- **Streamlit UIs** - Interactive web interfaces for your APIs

## The Magic of Single-Source Truth

Define your API once, generate everything else. That's the Firestone philosophy - no more keeping multiple files in sync, no more documentation drift.

Each guide below shows you how to generate a specific output type. Pick the one you need, or generate them all!
