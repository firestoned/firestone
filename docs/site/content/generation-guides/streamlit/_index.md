# Streamlit UI Generation

## From Data to Interactive UI in Minutes

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that transforms data scripts into shareable web apps with minimal effort. It's incredibly powerful for data scientists and developers who want to quickly create interactive dashboards, data visualization tools, or simple CRUD interfaces without needing extensive web development expertise.

`firestone` leverages Streamlit's simplicity to generate interactive data management UIs directly from your resource definitions. Imagine defining your data models once and instantly getting a web application that allows you to:

-   View and filter your resources.
-   Create new resource instances.
-   Edit existing resource data.
-   Delete resources.

This capability significantly accelerates the prototyping and internal tool development process, allowing you to quickly visualize and interact with your API's data models.
