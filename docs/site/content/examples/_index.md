# Examples

## Learning by Doing

The best way to understand `firestone`'s capabilities is to see it in action. This section provides a collection of practical, real-world examples that illustrate how to define resources and generate APIs, CLIs, and UIs for various use cases.

Each example comes with:
-   **Resource Blueprint:** The YAML definition of the resources.
-   **Generation Commands:** The `firestone` commands used to produce the output.
-   **Output Snippets:** Key parts of the generated OpenAPI spec, CLI output, or Streamlit UI.
-   **Explanation:** A breakdown of the concepts demonstrated in the example.

By working through these examples, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to apply `firestone` to your own projects and solve common API design challenges.
