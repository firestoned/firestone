Resource-Based Approach to Building APIs

``firestone`` allows you to build OpenAPI, AsyncAPI and gRPC specs based off one or
more resource json schema files. This allows you to focus on what really
matters, the resource you are developing!

Once you have generated the appropriate specification file for your project, you
can then use the myriad of libraries and frameworks to generate stub code for
you.

**The primary premise of this project is not to introduce any new "language" to describe your
resources(s), use JSON Schema!**

THis makes it easy to come up to speed and little to no prior knowledge to get
going.

Having said that, the schema for a resource provides additional helpful functionality,
see [schema](#schema) section.

## Quick Start

You can use pip or poetry to install and run ``firestone``. We suggest using pip if you wish to install
`firestone`` machine-wide, else, for local use, use poetry.

### pip

It's a simple as running the following ``pip`` command:

```
sudo pip install firestoned
```

NOTE: yes, `firestone**d**`, not `firestone`! This is because there already is a, albeit emtpy, repo
on pypi.org with the same name...

### poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is a great build tool for python that
allows you to build and run all locally in a virtual environment. This is great
for checking out the tool and playing around with `firestone` itself.

```
brew install poetry
poetry install
poetry build
```

## Running

Now that you have a copy of ``firestone``, let's try running it with the
example resource provided, an addressbook!

Note: if running within poetry build, simply prepend commands with ``poetry run``

For the remainder of this documentation, we will assume you have installed firestone.

### Generate an OpenAPI Spec

```
firestone \
    generate \
    --title 'Addressbook resource' \
    --description 'A simple addressBook example' \
    --resources examples/addressBook/resource.yaml \
    openapi
    --security '{"name": "bearer_auth", "scheme": "bearer", "type": "http", "bearerFormat": "JWT"}' \
```

Let's quickly dissect this command:

- we are telling firestone to generate an `openapi` spec, given the ``title``,
  ``description`` and the two given resource files.
- By default, this will output the specification file to stdout, alternatively
  you can provide the `-O` option to output to a specific file.

You can also, add the command line `--ui-server` tot he end, which will launch a
small webserver and run the Swagger UI to view this specification file.

```
firestone --debug generate --title 'Example person and addressBook API' \
    --description 'An example API with more than one resource' \
    --resources examples/addressBook.yaml,examples/person.yaml \
    openapi \
    --security '{"name": "bearer_auth", "scheme": "bearer", "type": "http", "bearerFormat": "JWT"}' \
    --ui-server

```

Now you can use your browser to navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/apidocs`

## Schema

It all begins with your resource definition! This is done using JSON schema and
we have provided an example in our `examples` directory, called addressBook. We
will use this to describe how the schema is setup and how you can adapt to your
own.

Here is the full file:

```yaml
name: addressBook
description: An example of an addressBook resource
version: 1.0
version_in_path: false
default_query_params:
  - name: limit
    description: Limit the number of responses back
    in: params
    schema:
      type: integer
  - name: offset
    description: The offset to start returning resources
    in: params
    schema:
      type: integer
descriptions:
  resource:
    get: List all addresses in this addressbook.
    head: Determine the existence and size of addresses in this addressbook.
    patch: Patch one or more addresses in this addressbook.
    post: Create a new address in this addressbook, a new address key will be created.
    delete: Delete all addresses from this addressbook.
  instance:
    get: Get a specific address from this addressbook.
    head: Determine the existence and size of this address.
    patch: Patch this address in the addressbook.
    put: Put a new address in this addressbook, with the given address key.
    delete: Delete an address from this addressbook.
schema:
  type: array
  key:
    name: address_key
    schema:
      description: A unique identifier for an addressbook entry.
      type: string
  #responseCodes:
  # - 200
  # - 201
  query_params:
    - name: city
      description: Filter by city name
      schema:
        type: string
      methods:
        - get
  items:
    type: object
    properties:
      addrtype:
        description: The address type, e.g. work or home
        type: string
        enum:
          - work
          - home
      street:
        description: The street and civic number of this address
        type: string
      city:
        description: The city of this address
        type: string
      state:
        description: The state of this address
        type: string
      country:
        description: The country of this address
        type: string
```

### Metadata

There is a certain amount of metadata that all of these specifications
use/require, and this is done at the top of the resource,yaml; for posterity,
they are:

```yaml
name: addressBook
description: An example of an addressBook resource
version: 1.0
```

#### `name`

The name is used in various places, including as the root to API URLs, for
example in OpenAPI, `/addressBook`

#### `description`

This is self evident, I hope, the description of this resource and is used nt he
generated specification files.

#### `descriptions`

This is a map/dict of either `resource` and/or `instance`, which itself is a map or
methods to descriptions, e.g.:


```yaml
descriptions:
  resource:
    get: List all addresses in this addressbook.
    head: Determine the existence and size of addresses in this addressbook.
    patch: Patch one or more addresses in this addressbook.
    post: Create a new address in this addressbook, a new address key will be created.
    delete: Delete all addresses from this addressbook.
```

#### `methods`

This is a map/dict of `resource`, and/or `instance`, and/or `instance_attrs`
(the instance attributes to expose), and a list of methods to explicitly expose,
e.g.:


```yaml
methods:
  resource:
    - get
    - post
    - put
```

#### `version`

The version of this resource definition, this cna alternatively be used in the
URL as well, see below `version_in_path`

#### `version_in_path`

This attribute defines whether to prepend the version defined above in the URL paths, e.g., for the
above, you would get: `/v1.0/addressBook`.

#### `default_query_params`

You can provide a list of default query parameters that will be added to all HTTP methods,
or optionally you can provide a list of the HTTP methods, for which `firestone` will add.


### Generate OpenAPI Client

Now, to generate your OpenAPI client, you will need the `openapi-generator` command, and this can be
used to generate client code in many languages. For more details on this project, see [here](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

This client code can then be used as an SDK or used by our CLI generation, see below.

```
openapi-generator generate \
    -i examples/addressbook/openapi.yaml \
    -g python-nextgen \
    -o /tmp/addressbook-client \
    --skip-validate-spec \
    -c examples/addressbook/openapi-gen-config.json
```

### Generate Python CRUD CLI

Now that you have generated the client code, you can also generate a CRUD, Python Click-based
CLI around your code. This generator creates a standalone script or as a module to be used
in your console scripts, as part of your project build.

Here is an example command we use to generate the example Addressbook.

```
firestone generate \
    --title 'Addressbook CLI' \
    --description 'This is the CLI for the example Addressbook' \
    --resources examples/addressbook/addressbook.yaml,examples/addressbook/person.yaml \
    --version 1.0 \
     cli \
     --pkg addressbook \
     --client-pkg addressbook.client > examples/addressbook/main.py
```

Let's quickly dissect this command:

- we are telling firestone to generate an `openapi` spec, given the ``title``,
  ``description`` and the two given resource files.
- By default, this will output the specification file to stdout, alternatively
  you can provide the `-O` option to output to a specific file.
